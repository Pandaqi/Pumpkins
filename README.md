# Carving Pumpkins & Dwarfing Dumplings

This is the source code for my game [Carving Pumpkins & Dwarfing Dumplings](https://pandaqi.com/carving-pumpkins-dwarfing-dumplings).

It was made in Godot 3. 

It was meant to be a quick Halloween-themed game, but the old enemy of scope creep visited me. (In fact, the original document just said "spinoff from Sheepe game, actually uses the slicing algorithm, should be quick and fun".)

There is some great stuff in here. There's some terrible stuff in here. Use it however you like.
